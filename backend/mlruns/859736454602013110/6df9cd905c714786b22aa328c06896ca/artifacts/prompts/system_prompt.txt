                - User level & Goal: Prepare for SAT
                - Available time: 8 days
                - Mode: Fast Learn (High Weightage)
                
                TASK:
                Generate a module-wise syllabus-aligned study plan for SAT.
                
                    FAST LEARN MODE (CRITICAL):
                    - Prioritize ONLY topics with high weightage in the exam.
                    - Skip low-weightage or optional topics.
                    - Focus on maximizing score in minimum time.
                    - Ensure even with fewer topics, the pedagogical sequence remains logical.
                    
                
                CRITICAL SEQUENCING RULES:
                1. PEDAGOGICAL FLOW: You MUST order modules in a logical pedagogical sequence.
                2. Master building blocks before tackling complex topics.
